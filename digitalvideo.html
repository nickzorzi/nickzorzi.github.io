<h1><i>The Package</i>, 2024, Art 105</h1>
<p>For my first project of the class, I created an action short film about a down on his luck protagonist who takes a job to intercept a package for his boss. This short film inhibits video editing and filimg concepts that were taught, such as: shot placement, blending modes, video composting, typography, vector & rasterized graphics, color grading, sound design, transitions, and etc.</p>

<h1><i>Spacehound</i>, 2024, Art 105</h1>
<p>For my second project of the class, I created an action short film about a dog who lives in space and chases down falling asteroids which lands on a nearby planet. The focus of the project was to include AI generated works to composite into a short film. This short film inhibits video editing and filimg concepts that were taught, such as: greenscreen, particle effects, 3d camera movment, blending modes, video composting, typography, vector & rasterized graphics, color grading, sound design, and etc.</p>

<h1><i>The Screwdriver</i>, 2022, Art 75</h1>
<p>For my final project of the class, I created a comedy horror short film about a screwdriver that falls down from space and is picked up by a group of teenagers who are hunted down for that very screwdriver. The short film inhibits concepts that were taught and used throughout the semester, such as: green screening, motion tracking, color grading, sound design, and etc.</p>

<h1><i>10pm</i>, 2022, Art 75</h1>
<p>The purpose of this project is to properly display time in a cinematic story. In this short film, I tell the story of a school boy who comes home from school and does homework until 10pm hits when the school boy transcends into a new world where time starts to speed up.</p>

<h1><i>Shrink Film</i>, 2022, Art 75</h1>
<p>For the Shrink Film, I decided to create a short story about how I can shrink my dog with a remote controller and take him around. Using a greenscreen and motion tracking on After Effects, I was successfully able to make my dog appear as if he was the size of my hand.</p>
