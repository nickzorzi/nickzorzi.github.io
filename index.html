	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Nicolas Zorzi, I am a Digital Media Art major here at SJSU. I am a second-generation American who was born and raised in the Bay Area, in San Mateo County. Both my parents were born and raised in Italy, but later immigrated to the US. Due to this, I often travel to Italy to visit my relatives and I also learned how to speak Italian at the same time as English.</p>
	<p>Since a young age I loved to create art, but high school is where I fell in love with it. More specifically, I fell in love with digital art and video editing and pursued it as a hobby. This passion for art led me to SJSU where I applied and became a student in DMA. Both inside and outside of SJSU, I love to make all sorts of digital art. More specifically I love to make <a href="digitalvideo.html">digital videos</a>, <a href="graphics.html">graphics</a> and <a href="3dmodeling.html">3d modeling</a>. Outside of SJSU, the graphics and digital videos I make are commissioned usually for social media marketing and promotional purposes. For fun, I 3d model video game maps for games such as CS:GO and also make 3d art pieces.</p>
	<p>In regards to my educational goals, I plan to achieve the best grades in my ability and to strive to graduate with a BFA in DMA. I fully expect to work hard as a student but more importantly as an artist in order to meet the goals and standards set in place in the BFA DMA program area. Additionally, I plan to pursue internships and job opportunities with the expertise I acquire as a DMA student at SJSU. Lastly, I hope to always learn more in order to create more.</p>
