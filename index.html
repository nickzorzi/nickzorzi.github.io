	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Nicolas Zorzi, I am a Digital Media Art major here at SJSU.</p>
	<p>I chose to come here to SJSU to pursue a degree in DMA because it is my passion. Like most people, as a young child I would love to draw, color, and create art pieces that expressed what was on my mind. Throughout school, it became apparent that what I loved to do the most was be creative and create things over more academic endeavors like math or science. During High School, I would take my first art classes and confirm my goals as a college student. I took a digital art class and video editing class which inspired me to learn more about the mediums via videos and articles online. At the first ever film festival held by my school, I won best edited video and it inspired me even more to learn more. I began to do freelancing jobs to make graphics and edit videos from online websites and from my friends. Fast forward to application season, I decided to apply to SJSU to pursue an art major because I had done research and found that SJSU had very innovative digital art degree programs and amazing faculty and community. </p>
	<p>This brings us to today, I have my eyes set on the DMA BFA degree program. I want to pursue a BFA for DMA because it is a perfect way to learn even more and develop more skills as a digital artist. With the DMA BFA degree, I plan to take internships and eventually a job in the video game industry. The reason why I planned for the video game industry is because one of my most notable hobbies is playing video games. I love to play video games and I also love to do map making for FPS games such as CS:GO. Using the source tools, I have created a couple of barebones maps for the game for fun. I love the concept of creating a world where a player can be enveloped in. With that being said, I am really hopeful for the future and I canâ€™t wait to learn more and subsequently create more.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to read my biography! Please feel free to navigate the tabs above to different artworks I made in the classes of Art 74, Art 75, and Art 12.</p>
