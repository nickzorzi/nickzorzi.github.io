	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Nicolas Zorzi, I am a Digital Media Art major here at SJSU. I was born and raised in the Bay Area, in San Mateo county.</p>
	<p>Since a young age I loved to create art, but high school is where I fell in love with it. More specifically, I fell in love with digital art and video editing and pursued it as a hobby. This passion for art led me to SJSU where I applied and became a student in DMA. Outside of the classes I take at SJSU, I love to make all kinds of digital art in my free time. I produce a lot of graphics and digital videos for commissions and I do 3d modeling for fun. The graphics and digital videos I make are commissioned usually for social media marketing and promotional purposes. For fun, I 3d model video game maps for games such as CS:GO and make art pieces.</p>
	<p>In addition to my goals as an artist at SJSU, I also have a lot of ambitions. In regards to my educational goals, I plan to achieve the best grades in my ability and to strive to graduate with a BFA in DMA. I fully expect to work hard as a student but more importantly as an artist in order to meet the goals and standards set in place in the BFA DMA program area. Additionally, I plan to pursue internships and job opportunities with the expertise I acquired as an DMA student at SJSU. Lastly, I hope to always learn more in order to create more.</p>
